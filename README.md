# Prompt-Based Data Analytics

This repository contains a project that provides an interactive web application for prompt-driven data analysis using Streamlit and pandasai. The application allows users to upload CSV files and perform data queries using natural language prompts powered by OpenAI's language model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simplify data analysis by enabling users to interact with their data using natural language prompts. The application supports CSV file uploads and provides an intuitive interface for querying and visualizing data.

### Key Features:
- **Prompt-Driven Analysis:** Utilize OpenAI's language model to query and analyze data using natural language prompts.
- **CSV Uploads:** Users can upload their CSV files for analysis.
- **Secure API Management:** Implemented secure management of the OpenAI API key.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with Streamlit to ensure an intuitive and accessible user experience.
